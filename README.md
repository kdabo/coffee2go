# Reactshop

Reactshop is a single page application built using React, Typescript and React Router. It has two views: products and admin.
Products view displays list of products and gives the ability to click on each product and see product's description and price.
Admin view shows two nested routes: users and product. Clicking the users option will branch further into list of users and further into information on specific user.

This project is demo for:

- installing React Router with routing types
- declaring routes
- creating navigation
- route parameters
- handling not found routes
- implementing page redirects
- query parameters
- route prompts
- nested routes
- animated transitions
